- [ ] test duplicate item handling for receipt upload
- [ ] proper backend so people don't have to paste their api key
- [ ] bulk splitting for appetizers. Like if there were 3 appetizers split amongst the whole table, you shouldn't have to go one by one and split all of them
- [ ] weird scrolling bug on chrome mobile
- [ ] SEO. doesn't show up on google.
- [ ] for main payer, calculate tip and new total for you so can just write that down on the check.
- [x] after uploading a very big receipt, the screen goes blank. reproduce on laptop and debug. probably just too big for qr code.
- [x] [improve friend ux](./planning/friend-ux-improvements.plan.md)
  - [x] instead of friends x-ing out what they didn't get, have them just check what they did get. Most stuff, they didn't get. Maybe a sequence of pages instead of just one.
  - Implemented 3-step wizard: (1) check items, (2) configure splits, (3) pay. Mobile-optimized and foolproof.
