- [ ] [improve friend ux](./planning/friend-ux-improvements.plan.md)
- [ ] proper backend so people don't have to paste their api key

- [ ] weird scrolling bug on chrome mobile
- [ ] after uploading a very big receipt, the screen goes blank. reproduce on laptop and debug. probably just too big for qr code.
